# Principles of Agro Processing

## Food

Food is one of the basic needs of the human being and is required for the normal functioning of the body and for healthy growth and development.

Any substance (solid or liquid) that contains the six essential nutrients:

* Carbohydrates
* Water
* Fats
* Proteins
* Vitamins 
* Minerals

Foods in their natural forms are living, once harvested they will deteriorate or spoil.

_Senescence_ is the process by which food deteriorates naturally.

Two reasons for the degradation of wholesome foods:

1. _Autolysis_: the breakdown of an organism by substances originating within that organism such as enzymes

2. _Microbiological degradation_: occurs due to attack by microorganisms such as bacteria, yeasts, and molds

**Name of the Nutrient** | **Sources** | **Function**
--- | --- | ---
**Carbohydrates** (energy giving food) | Rice, potato, wheat, sugar | Provides energy
**Fats** (energy giving food) | Butter, ghee, milk, cheese | Gives more energy compared to carbohydrates
**Vitamins and minerals** (protective food) | Fruits and vegetables | Required for normal growth and development
**Proteins** (body building food) | Milk, eggs, meat, fish, soybean | Helps in building and repair of body

## Agro Processing

The set of methods or techniques used to transform raw ingredients into other forms for consumption by humans or animals, either in the home or by the food processing industry.

Involve the combination of basic sciences such as Chemistry, Biology, and Physics with various engineering principles.

* Heating
* Drying/Dehydration
* Cooling
* Freezing
* Fluid Transfer and Control
* Solid Transfer and Control
* Filtration
* Mixing
* Grinding
* Pressing
* Extruding
* Fermentation
* Weighing
* Packaging

Why process food?

* To convert it to a form which is more readily edible
* To prevent quality degradation of natural foods
* To create processed which humans have developed over time
* To create novel or innovative foods

## Food Security

Achieved when persons always have physical and economic access to safe and nutritious foods, in keeping with their dietary needs and food preferences for a healthy life.

Four dimensions of food security:
1. **Food Availability** - food production, food stock levels, food trade
2. **Food Access** - access to resources to acquire food
3. **Food Utilization** - food preparation/food safety, diet diversity
4. **Food Stability** - inadequate access to food on a periodic basis caused by adverse weather, economic shocks such as unemployment and rising food prices


## Food Insecurity

Persons' inability to procure food can be short term or long term.

1. **Transitory Food Insecurity** - short term/temporary
2. **Chronic Food Insecurity** - long term/persistent
