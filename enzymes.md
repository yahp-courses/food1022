# Enzymes

Enzymes and catalyst bot affect the rate of a reaction. All known enzymes are catalysts, but not all catalysts are enzymes.

Enzymes are largely organic in nature and are bio-catalysts while no-enzymatic catalysts can be inorganic compounds.

Neither are consumed in the reaction.

|    | Catalyst | Enzyme |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Function	| Catalysts are substances that increase or decrease the rate of a chemical reaction but remain unchanged.	| Enzymes are proteins that increase rate of chemical reactions converting substrate into product. |
| Molecular weight	| Low molecular weight compounds.	|High molecular weight globular proteins. |
| Types	| There are two types of catalysts â€“ positive and negative catalysts. |	There are two types of enzymes - activation enzymes and inhibitory enzymes. |
| Nature |	Catalysts are simple inorganic molecules. |	Enzymes are complex proteins. |
| Alternate terms |	Inorganic catalyst. |	Organic catalyst or bio catalyst. |
| Reaction rates |	Typically slower |	Several times faster |
| Specificity |	They are not specific and therefore end up producing residues with errors |	Enzymes are highly specific producing large amount of good residues |
| Conditions |	High temp, pressure	| Mild conditions, physiological pH and temperature |
| C-C and C-H bonds | absent |	present |
| Example |	vanadium oxide | amylase, lipase |
| Activation Energy	| Lowers it	| Lowers it |


## Enzymes in Food Processing

| Name | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Glucoamylase |    |
| Protease | Weakening gluten in dough, shortening mixing time |
| Lipase | Delaying Starch aging, Improving bread quality and preservation ability |
| Esterase | a hydrolase enzyme that splits esters into acids and alohol, Alcoholic Beverages -> modifies oil and fats in fruit juices Produce fragrances and flavour |


# Maillard Reaction

The Maillard reaction is a form of non-enzymatic browning that occurs in foods when proteins and/or amino acids chemically react with carbohydrates of reducing sugars. Applying heat during cooking accelerates and continues this intricate process, which elevates the taste, aromas, and appearance of food.

# Hydro colloids

**Additives to replace the effects of glucose**

* GG -> Guar Gum
* XG -> Xanthan Gum
* CMC -> Carboxymethyl Cellulose
* LBG -> Locust Bean Gum



Gluten becomes elastic and helps trap the air etc. giving shape to the bread.

Without gluten: denser, not as much volume (not rising as much). Denser bread would give you higher glucose etc.

Example cassava is only starch, so adding cassava into bread replaces starch and protein with just starches, which breaks down into only glucose.
