# Enzymes

Enzymes and catalyst bot affect the rate of a reaction. All known enzymes are catalysts, but not all catalysts are enzymes.

Enzymes are largely organic in nature and are bio-catalysts while no-enzymatic catalysts can be inorganic compounds.

Neither are consumed in the reaction.

|    | Catalyst | Enzyme |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Function	| Catalysts are substances that increase or decrease the rate of a chemical reaction but remain unchanged.	| Enzymes are proteins that increase rate of chemical reactions converting substrate into product. |
| Molecular weight	| Low molecular weight compounds.	|High molecular weight globular proteins. |
| Types	| There are two types of catalysts â€“ positive and negative catalysts. |	There are two types of enzymes - activation enzymes and inhibitory enzymes. |
| Nature |	Catalysts are simple inorganic molecules. |	Enzymes are complex proteins. |
| Alternate terms |	Inorganic catalyst. |	Organic catalyst or bio catalyst. |
| Reaction rates |	Typically slower |	Several times faster |
| Specificity |	They are not specific and therefore end up producing residues with errors |	Enzymes are highly specific producing large amount of good residues |
| Conditions |	High temp, pressure	| Mild conditions, physiological pH and temperature |
| C-C and C-H bonds | absent |	present |
| Example |	vanadium oxide | amylase, lipase |
| Activation Energy	| Lowers it	| Lowers it |


The Maillard reaction is a form of non-enzymatic browning that occurs in foods when proteins and/or amino acids chemically react with carbohydrates of reducing sugars. Applying heat during cooking accelerates and continues this intricate process, which elevates the taste, aromas, and appearance of food.


## Enzymes in Food Processing

| Name | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Glucoamylase |    |
| Protease | Weakening gluten in dough, shortening mixing time |
| Lipase | Delaying Starch aging, Improving bread quality and preservation ability |
| Esterase | a hydrolase enzyme that splits esters into acids and alohol |
