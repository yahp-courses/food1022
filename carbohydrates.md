# Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are important sources of energy.

They all contain 3 elements (Carbon Hydrogen Oxygen). They are produced by plants during photosynthesis.

Three groups of carbohydrates:
* Monosaccharides
* Disaccharides
* Polysaccharides

## Monosaccharides

Called simple sugars. There are 3 main monosaccharides:

1. Fructose
2. Glucose
3. Galactose

## Disaccharides

Called double sugars.

* Sucrose (glucose and fructose)
* Lactose (galactose and glucose)
* Maltose (glucose and glucose)


## Polysaccharides

Formed from a varying number of monosaccharides. Usually insoluble in cold water and tasteless

* Starch
* Dextrin
* Cellulose
* Pectin
* Glycogen
