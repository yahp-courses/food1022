# Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are important sources of energy.

They all contain 3 elements (Carbon Hydrogen Oxygen). They are produced by plants during photosynthesis.

Three groups of carbohydrates:
* Monosaccharides
* Disaccharides
* Polysaccharides

## Monosaccharides

Called simple sugars. There are 3 main monosaccharides:

1. Fructose
2. Glucose
3. Galactose

## Disaccharides

Called double sugars.

* Sucrose (glucose and fructose)
* Lactose (galactose and glucose)
* Maltose (glucose and glucose)


## Polysaccharides

Formed from a varying number of monosaccharides. Usually insoluble in cold water and tasteless

* Starch
* Dextrin
* Cellulose
* Pectin
* Glycogen

* **Alpha glycosidic bond**
	eg. altose, starch  
	Easily broken down into its constituent simple sugars


* **Beta glycosidic bond**
	eg. dietary fibre  
	Body can't break down these and use them
	some are digested in the large intestine and rectum

**Enzymes**

Biological catalysts, (protein)

**Homework**
What are enzymes and what are catalysts? 
Give examples.

---

**Glucose** and **Fructose** are the most common monosaccharides in the average diet.

* They are used to produce syrups to sweeten products

## Honey

## Sucrose (Cane sugar or beet)
